# 1320-ridge-velocity-code
This is the 13Â°20' Mid-Atlantic velocity building code using the refraction velocity profile from Peirce et al 2019. 
This velocity code made a basic assumption that there are no slow velocity zones subsurface in the area of interest.
This velocity code reads in seafloor horizons stacked and water migrated data which gives times of the seafloor hosizon.
The computed velocity files are converted to NetCDF5 file for further conversion to segy file and use in a seismic processing software.
